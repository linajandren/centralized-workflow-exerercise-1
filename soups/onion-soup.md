# French Onion Soup
Typical dish from region Centre Val de Loire.
## Ingredients

4 large yellow onions, thinly sliced

3 tbsp butter

1 tbsp olive oil

2 cloves garlic, minced

1 tsp sugar

1 tsp salt

1 tsp fresh thyme (or ½ tsp dried thyme)

2 tbsp all-purpose flour

1 dl (100 ml) dry white wine (optional)

1.5 L beef or vegetable stock

Freshly ground black pepper

1 baguette, sliced

200 g Gruyère or Comté cheese, grated

## Instructions

In a large pot, melt the butter with olive oil over medium heat.

Add the sliced onions, salt, and sugar. Cook slowly, stirring often, until caramelized and golden brown (about 30–40 minutes).

Add the minced garlic and thyme, cook for 1–2 minutes.

Sprinkle in the flour, stir well, and cook for another 2 minutes.

Deglaze with white wine (if using), scraping up browned bits. Let it reduce slightly.

Add the stock, bring to a boil, then reduce heat and let simmer for 20–30 minutes. Season with pepper to taste.

Meanwhile, toast baguette slices in the oven until crisp.

Ladle soup into ovenproof bowls, top each with toasted bread and grated cheese.

Place bowls under the broiler until cheese is melted and bubbling.

Serve hot and enjoy! 🥖🧅🧀
